It&#39;s a MacOS tool and its currently in heavy development (and released ASAP). Heavy means here, that it gets an update almost every day. </p>\n\n<p>With that, we needed a fast and efficient update mechanism within the app, something that checks every day for updates and installs it. On MacOS there are more-or-less two ways to deploy your app this way: You use the Mac App-Store with all its (dis)advantages or you use <a href=\"http://sparkle.andymatuschak.org/\">Sparkle</a>. The latter is the de-facto standard if it comes to auto-updates and deployments on the user side. And so we integrated it.</p>\n\n<h3>How it works</h3>\n\n<p>Sparkle uses a RSS feed <code data-syntax=\"text-only\">Appcast.xml\n</code> with some custom sugar to check for new releases, each <code data-syntax=\"text-only\">item\n</code> is a release, each release has a separate <code data-syntax=\"text-only\">sparkle:releaseNotesLink\n</code> tag which points to a <code data-syntax=\"text-only\">.html\n</code> file with the latest Release Notes. Thats the description you&#39;ll see in the updater window, it&#39;s a simple Webkit canvas.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code data-syntax=\"text-only\">&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt;\n&lt;rss version=&quot;2.0&quot;\n     xmlns:dc=&quot;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/&quot;\n     xmlns:sparkle=&quot;http://www.andymatuschak.org/xml-namespaces/sparkle&quot;&gt;\n\n    &lt;channel&gt;\n        &lt;title&gt;GingerNotify Changelog&lt;/title&gt;\n        &lt;link&gt;https://path/to/Appcast.xml&lt;/link&gt;\n        &lt;language&gt;en&lt;/language&gt;\n\n        &lt;item&gt;\n            &lt;sparkle:releaseNotesLink&gt;https://path/to/v2.4 (5) Release Notes.html&lt;/sparkle:releaseNotesLink&gt;\n            &lt;pubDate&gt;Mo, 10 Dez 2012 11:49:22 +0100&lt;/pubDate&gt;\n            &lt;enclosure\n                type=&quot;application/octet-stream&quot;\n                url=&quot;https://path/to/v2.4 (5).zip&quot;\n                sparkle:version=&quot;5&quot;\n                sparkle:shortVersionString=&quot;2.4&quot;/&gt;\n        &lt;/item&gt;\n\n        &lt;item&gt;\n            &lt;sparkle:releaseNotesLink&gt;https://path/to/v2.4 (4) Release Notes.html&lt;/sparkle:releaseNotesLink&gt;\n            &lt;pubDate&gt;Mo, 10 Dez 2012 11:49:22 +0100&lt;/pubDate&gt;\n            &lt;enclosure\n                type=&quot;application/octet-stream&quot;\n                url=&quot;https://path/to/v2.4 (4).zip&quot;\n                sparkle:version=&quot;4&quot;\n                sparkle:shortVersionString=&quot;2.4&quot;/&gt;\n        &lt;/item&gt;\n    &lt;/channel&gt;\n&lt;/rss&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, for every release there are quite a lot of actions to do:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Compile the app, sign, export and zip it</li>\n<li>Create and write a new corresponding ReleaseNotes.html file</li>\n<li>Add that to the &quot;Appcast.xml&quot; feed</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And so you&#39;ll end up with a lot of files.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"sparkle1.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<h3>Make it simpler</h3>\n\n<p>The first thing you&#39;ll notice is that you don&#39;t really need a separate ReleaseNotes.html for every single release. They can all live in one file, one release after another. That has also the advantage that the user can see what happened in the past, not just in the very latest release:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"sparkle2.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<h3>Simpler!</h3>\n\n<p>Not bad, however there was one thing that bugs me most: Why do I have to write a ReleaseNotes.html file when I already have to update this Appcast.xml feed? We can totally do this in one file, the Appcast.xml holding both, the release list and its changes. </p>\n\n<p>The idea is: First we add the release text, which would go into this separate file, into the feed. I added a new tag <code data-syntax=\"text-only\">sparkle:releaseNotes\n</code> for this, but if you want to keep it in-line with a classic RSS Feed, use `description&#39;.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code data-syntax=\"text-only\">&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt;\n&lt;?xml-stylesheet type=&quot;text/xsl&quot; href=&quot;Appcast.xsl&quot;?&gt;\n\n// \\\u2026\n\n&lt;item&gt;\n    &lt;sparkle:releaseNotes&gt;\n    &lt;![CDATA[\n        &lt;ul&gt;\n            &lt;li&gt;Added a button to change Desktop notification settings right from the prefs screen&lt;/li&gt;\n            &lt;li&gt;Fixed the URL to obtain the API token&lt;/li&gt;\n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    ]]&gt;\n    &lt;/sparkle:releaseNotes&gt;\n    &lt;sparkle:releaseNotesLink&gt;https://path/to/Appcast.xml&lt;/sparkle:releaseNotesLink&gt;\n    &lt;pubDate&gt;Mo, 10 Dez 2012 11:49:22 +0100&lt;/pubDate&gt;\n    &lt;enclosure\n        type=&quot;application/octet-stream&quot;\n        url=&quot;https://path/to/v2.4 (5).zip&quot;\n        sparkle:version=&quot;5&quot;\n        sparkle:shortVersionString=&quot;2.4&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;/item&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The next step is to have the <code data-syntax=\"text-only\">sparkle:releaseNotesLink\n</code> point to itself:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code data-syntax=\"text-only\">&lt;sparkle:releaseNotesLink&gt;https://path/to/Appcast.xml&lt;/sparkle:releaseNotesLink&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>What would happen now is, that the update window would display plain XML.

It's a MacOS tool and its currently in heavy development (and released ASAP). Heavy means here, that it gets an update almost every day. \n\nWith that, we needed a fast and efficient update mechanism within the app, something that checks every day for updates and installs it. On MacOS there are more-or-less two ways to deploy your app this way: You use the Mac App-Store with all its (dis)advantages or you use [Sparkle](http://sparkle.andymatuschak.org/). The latter is the de-facto standard if it comes to auto-updates and deployments on the user side. And so we integrated it.\n\n### How it works\n\nSparkle uses a RSS feed `Appcast.xml` with some custom sugar to check for new releases, each `item` is a release, each release has a separate `sparkle:releaseNotesLink` tag which points to a `.html` file with the latest Release Notes. Thats the description you'll see in the updater window, it's a simple Webkit canvas.\n\n```\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n<rss version=\"2.0\"\n     xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"\n     xmlns:sparkle=\"http://www.andymatuschak.org/xml-namespaces/sparkle\">\n\n    <channel>\n        <title>GingerNotify Changelog</title>\n        <link>https://path/to/Appcast.xml</link>\n        <language>en</language>\n\n        <item>\n            <sparkle:releaseNotesLink>https://path/to/v2.4 (5) Release Notes.html</sparkle:releaseNotesLink>\n            <pubDate>Mo, 10 Dez 2012 11:49:22 +0100</pubDate>\n            <enclosure\n                type=\"application/octet-stream\"\n                url=\"https://path/to/v2.4 (5).zip\"\n                sparkle:version=\"5\"\n                sparkle:shortVersionString=\"2.4\"/>\n        </item>\n\n        <item>\n            <sparkle:releaseNotesLink>https://path/to/v2.4 (4) Release Notes.html</sparkle:releaseNotesLink>\n            <pubDate>Mo, 10 Dez 2012 11:49:22 +0100</pubDate>\n            <enclosure\n                type=\"application/octet-stream\"\n                url=\"https://path/to/v2.4 (4).zip\"\n                sparkle:version=\"4\"\n                sparkle:shortVersionString=\"2.4\"/>\n        </item>\n    </channel>\n</rss>\n```\n\nSo, for every release there are quite a lot of actions to do:\n\n* Compile the app, sign, export and zip it\n* Create and write a new corresponding ReleaseNotes.html file\n* Add that to the \"Appcast.xml\" feed\n\nAnd so you'll end up with a lot of files.\n\n![](sparkle1.png)\n\n### Make it simpler\n\nThe first thing you'll notice is that you don't really need a separate ReleaseNotes.html for every single release. They can all live in one file, one release after another. That has also the advantage that the user can see what happened in the past, not just in the very latest release:\n\n![](sparkle2.png)\n\n### Simpler!\n\nNot bad, however there was one thing that bugs me most: Why do I have to write a ReleaseNotes.html file when I already have to update this Appcast.xml feed? We can totally do this in one file, the Appcast.xml holding both, the release list and its changes. \n\nThe idea is: First we add the release text, which would go into this separate file, into the feed. I added a new tag `sparkle:releaseNotes` for this, but if you want to keep it in-line with a classic RSS Feed, use `description'.\n\n```\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n<?xml-stylesheet type=\"text/xsl\" href=\"Appcast.xsl\"?>\n\n// \\\u2026\n\n<item>\n    <sparkle:releaseNotes>\n    <![CDATA[\n        <ul>\n            <li>Added a button to change Desktop notification settings right from the prefs screen</li>\n            <li>Fixed the URL to obtain the API token</li>\n        </ul>\n    ]]>\n    </sparkle:releaseNotes>\n    <sparkle:releaseNotesLink>https://path/to/Appcast.xml</sparkle:releaseNotesLink>\n    <pubDate>Mo, 10 Dez 2012 11:49:22 +0100</pubDate>\n    <enclosure\n        type=\"application/octet-stream\"\n        url=\"https://path/to/v2.4 (5).zip\"\n        sparkle:version=\"5\"\n        sparkle:shortVersionString=\"2.4\"/>\n</item>\n```\n\nThe next step is to have the `sparkle:releaseNotesLink` point to itself:\n\n```\n<sparkle:releaseNotesLink>https://path/to/Appcast.xml</sparkle:releaseNotesLink>\n```\n\nWhat would happen now is, that the update window would display plain XML. Not very pretty. What we need is to transform that to some pretty HTML, and thats where an XSL Stylesheet comes into the game. \n\n```\n<?xml-stylesheet type=\"text/xsl\" href=\"Appcast.xsl\"?>\n```\n\nThe webkit canvas supports XSLT (Version 1) so what will happen is: Sparkle uses the plain feed to obtain its information how to update the app. The webkit canvas loads this feed too, but because it supports XSLT, it will render the feed in a pretty style.\n\nAll you need to do is to place this `Appcast.xsl` along the `.xml` file:\n\n```\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n\n<xsl:stylesheet\n    version=\"1.0\"\n    xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"\n    xmlns:sparkle=\"http://www.andymatuschak.org/xml-namespaces/sparkle\"\n    xmlns:xsl=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform\">\n\n<xsl:output method=\"html\" encoding=\"utf-8\" />\n\n<xsl:template match=\"/\">\n    <html>\n    <head>\n        <title><xsl:value-of select=\"rss/channel/title\"/></title>\n    </head>\n    <body>\n        <xsl:apply-templates select=\"rss/channel/item\"/>\n    </body>\n    </html>\n</xsl:template>\n\n<xsl:template match=\"rss/channel/item\">\n    <div class=\"release\">\n        <h1>\n            <xsl:attribute name=\"title\">\n                <xsl:value-of select=\"pubDate\"/>\n            </xsl:attribute>\n            <xsl:attribute name=\"id\">\n                <xsl:value-of select=\"enclosure/@sparkle:version\"/>\n            </xsl:attribute>\n            Version <xsl:value-of select=\"enclosure/@sparkle:shortVersionString\"/>\n            (Build <xsl:value-of select=\"enclosure/@sparkle:version\"/>)\n        </h1>\n        <xsl:value-of select=\"sparkle:releaseNotes\" disable-output-escaping=\"yes\"/>\n    </div>\n</xsl:template>\n</xsl:stylesheet>\n```\n\nDone. There is visually no difference to before, but now there is only one file to maintain. \n\n![](sparkle3.png)\n\n### Even Simpler!\n\nLets add some sugar coat to this; I don't want to write HTML into my feed, most of the time there are some really plain strings for what was updated:\n\n```\n* Added feature A\n* Fixed Bug B\n* Fixed Bug C\n```\n\nLet's write this into the feed -- as is! \n\n```\n<item>\n    <sparkle:releaseNotes>\n    <![CDATA[\n        * Sparkle integration for easy updates\n        * The app is now code-signed to work without warning on MacOS Lion and later\n    ]]>\n    </sparkle:releaseNotes>\n\n    ...\n</item>\n```\n\nWe have to adjust the XSL a little to create list items out of those `* starred lines`. This is a really ugly syntax (in my opinion) but it does its job. XSLT2 has an internal function for this by the way, but neither Safari nor Chrome does support it yet. \n\n```\n<div class=\"release\">\n    <h1>...</h1>\n    <ul>\n        <xsl:call-template name=\"textline-to-line\">\n            <xsl:with-param name=\"text\" select=\"sparkle:releaseNotes\"/>\n        </xsl:call-template>\n    </ul>\n</div>\n\n\n<!-- \n    XSLT1 function to split lines by * and\n    create list items out of it \n-->\n<xsl:template match=\"text/text()\" name=\"textline-to-line\">\n    <xsl:param name=\"text\" select=\".\"/>\n    <xsl:param name=\"separator\" select=\"'*'\"/>\n    <xsl:choose>\n        <xsl:when test=\"not(contains($text, $separator))\">\n            <li><xsl:value-of select=\"normalize-space($text)\"/></li>\n        </xsl:when>\n        <xsl:otherwise>\n            <xsl:variable name=\"t\" select=\"normalize-space(substring-before($text, $separator))\"/>\n            <xsl:if test=\"not($t = '')\">\n            <li><xsl:value-of select=\"$t\"/></li>\n            </xsl:if>\n            <xsl:call-template name=\"textline-to-line\">\n                <xsl:with-param name=\"text\" select=\"substring-after($text, $separator)\"/>\n            </xsl:call-template>\n        </xsl:otherwise>\n    </xsl:choose>\n</xsl:template>\n```\n\n\n### Wrapping up\n\nThe earlier idea with Writing HTML into the feed wasn't so bad though. Just in case we need to write some more complex release notes, lets keep this. We just have to add an attribute `type=html` so the XSL parser later knows what to do:\n\n```\n<item>\n    <sparkle:releaseNotes type=\"html\">\n    <![CDATA[\n        <ul>\n            <li>Added a button to change Desktop notification settings right from the prefs screen</li>\n            <li>Fixed the URL to obtain the API token</li>\n        </ul>\n    ]]>\n    </sparkle:releaseNotes>\n</item>\n\n...\n\n<item>\n    <sparkle:releaseNotes>\n    <![CDATA[\n        * Sparkle integration for easy updates\n        * The app is now code-signed to work without warning on MacOS Lion and later\n    ]]>\n    </sparkle:releaseNotes>\n</item>\n```\n\nThe final XSL stylesheep will look like this:\n\n```\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n\n<xsl:stylesheet\n    version=\"1.0\"\n    xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"\n    xmlns:sparkle=\"http://www.andymatuschak.org/xml-namespaces/sparkle\"\n
